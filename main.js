/* 
ðŸ‘‰ It's a tough day for an office of hungry programmers. 
The pizzas have arrived and some of them have pineapple on them. You need to find a way
of removing the pineapple from the array of pizza toppings and return all other ingredients in an array..  

For example:
* Given[ham, cheese, tomato sauce, pineapple] your solution should return - [ham, cheese, tomato sauce]
if the ingredients does not include pineapple. you should return the original array.
